Welcome to the MiddleEarth Navigation Game!
Your journey begins here. 
First, navigate to the Shire and find the file in BagEnd to start your adventure.

Tip:
Get out of vim (if in vim) by pressing ESC, then typing colon, then q, then enter.
Then, type cd Shire. If you see nothing interesting in Shire, continue to go down to the next directory.
